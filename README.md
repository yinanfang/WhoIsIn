# WhoIsIn V_0.2

## About

This is an attempt to build an platform to gather local events and connect people. We planed to build a platform where user can login, find/create event, talk to other user. In this app, I used MVVM structure and introduced popular third party libraries like ReactiveCocoa and POP.

What I learned from this project:
  - Focus on a core feature and avoid complicated system or function
  - Write reusable libraries to avoid repetition
